# Probabilistic_reversal_learning_task

<b>1. This a probabilistic reversal learning task using PsychoPy. It is different from object alternation test in that the reward is probabilistic, i.e. it occurs only 80 % of the time for a correct response. This is in accordance with what is done by the Cambridge group ( https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.22-11-04563.2002 ).<b>
2. Contains a continuous, cumulative reward (in rupees) for each trail as we felt this will help keep the subjects engaged in the task.<b>
